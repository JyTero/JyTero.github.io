                    I’m Jyri Tero and this is my handcrafted portfolio to showcase my skills and projects. To jump straight to the said projects, click <a href = "WhatHaveIDone.html">here</a>.

                    I’m a 25-year-old, recently graduated, currently unemployed programmer from Southern Finland. I graduated with Bachelor of Engineering from the game programming track of South-Eastern Finland University of Applied Sciences.

					This site began its life as a place to put project reports during my studies. As such, many of the projects presented here contain an essay type project report.
					I’m currently going through the project pages to reformat them to have relevant information more readable.

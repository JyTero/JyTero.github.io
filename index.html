Hi! My name is Jyri Tero, and welcome to my portfolio page! This is the place where I put out all my stunnin’ and absolutely gorgeous works and projects that I’ve worked on, so feel free to peruse around! Admittedly, as of spring 2021, there isn’t too much to see here yet, but my studies have barely started, so make sure to come back every so often to see what new works of art me and my friends have pushed out! 				</p>

			<div id = "IntroCv">
				<p>
My school and work history are fairly short. I graduated from gymnasium, Helsingin medialukio, in spring of 2019, after which I worked at Grano oy, an advert and logistics company for six months before going to the compulsory military service. Six months of that and I started my current school, South-Eastern Finland University of Applied Sciences, XAMK with the plan to become a Bachelor of Software Engineering. I am due to graduate in summer of 2024. 				</p>

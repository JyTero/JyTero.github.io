				<p>
My school and work history are fairly short. I graduated from gymnasium, Helsingin medialukio, in spring of 2019, after which I worked at Grano oy, an advert and logistics company for six months before going to the compulsory military service. Six months of that and I started my current school, South-Eastern Finland University of Applied Sciences, XAMK with the plan to become a Bachelor of Software Engineering. I am due to graduate in summer of 2024. 				</p>

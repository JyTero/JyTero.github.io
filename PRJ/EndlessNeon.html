                        Endless Neon is an endless runner type of game set in a neon synth wave landscape made for Xamk Game Jam. The theme for the jam was “Arcade.” The game is made in Unity. Everything in the game was done by our team.

                    I was responsible mostly for the visual and aesthetic side of things. Most of the assets, excluding the terrain, player car and the fences on the sides of the road, were done by me. The idea for the visuals of the game came to me immediately upon hearing the theme for the jam, as I had been recently dabbled into the synth wave aesthetic and music at that point. The gameplay was designed by our team as a group effort. Due to the importance of certain type of music for the synth wave feel and our team having a person with music experience, we decided early on that music is to play an important role in the feel of the game and as such we settled on the music evolving depending on how many speed boosts the player gathers.

                    Here’s the trailer for the game. We decided to focus more on the looks, feels and polish of the game, rather than the abundance of gameplay or features.

                    The development was mostly issue free; programmer did have some issues with making the road pieces spawn at appropriate times even after gathering speed boosts. The one major issue we had was during the last 30 mins when we were trying to build and upload the game. The game ran well within the editor but after building it would not spawn anything after the initial hand placed ones had gone by. We had no idea what could’ve possibly caused that, nor did we have the time to look into it so we ended up rolling back a few pushes and the worked just fine. Even more confusing is that the builds we rolled back from were just about the main menu UI and adding a single new element there. That somehow broke everything.

                    The project is very much a success, ranking to tied 5th place of the favorites from jury and tied 1st place voted by jammers. I enjoyed working on the project since as I really liked the aesthetic we were going for and was really happy when I saw the built game running full screen on my PC at the end. This was my first actual Unity project I’ve worked on and I learned a lot about the Unity workflow, at least when it comes to level design. I tried to code a few pieces myself but due to lack of time and sleep and our team having an experienced programmer, I decided to not stress about that too much. I am very happy with the game and our team.
